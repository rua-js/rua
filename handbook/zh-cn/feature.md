# Feature

### Rapid Development
Combining awesome libraries into `one ibrary`, make them work
`seamlessly`. It's time to stop wasting time on finding libraries
and write same code over and over again.

### Easy To Use
We simplify usage of all libraries included in `Rua.js`, it's
much easier to use.

### Safe
We use `real-world-tested` and `well-developed` libraries from javascript
community or rewrite package that from other language.

### However
You still need following skills to use `Rua.js`

- Good understanding of `ES5` and `ES6` syntax
- Knowing how to use `yarn` or `npm`
